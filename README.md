# 61A Editor

Try the production version at https://code.cs61a.org!

## Web Editor
In the releases, download the latest `web.zip` file, activate the pipenv, and run `app.py` to start a Flask server. Alternatively, run
```
yarn
yarn web-dist
yarn web-dev
```
to start the editor in development mode.

## Local Editor (experimental!)
To try, ensure that `python` is installed on your machine, and can be run with the `python3.6` command (will be made configurable in the future).

Then, run
```
yarn
yarn dist
yarn dev
```
and the editor will start.
